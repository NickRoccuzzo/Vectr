# Vectr

**Vectr** is a Python-based tool designed to simplify stock option analysis. Built on the powerful `yfinance` module and supported by additional libraries such as `Flask`, `Pandas`, and `Plotly`, Vectr provides users with an intuitive interface for exploring and visualizing stock options data.

### **üîëKey Features:**
- *Search Any Optionable Stock Ticker(s)*: Easily search for single or multiple stock tickers across the entire stock market. ("Optionable" stocks are those with available options for purchase.)

- *Dynamic Visualizations*: Generate interactive line graphs, bar graphs, and other visual enhancements to analyze options chains.

- *Market Insights*: Assess whether the market sentiment for a stock is bullish or bearish based on its options data.
